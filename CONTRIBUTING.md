## 📝 Commit Messages

We encourage using [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

- `feat:` → a new feature
- `fix:` → a bug fix
- `chore:` → changes to tooling, configs, or docs
- `refactor:` → code refactor without changing features

Example:

```
feat: add project page layout
fix: correct header alignment on mobile
```

## 🎨 Code Style

- TypeScript **strict mode** is enforced.
- Keep components **small, focused, and accessible**.
- Favor **readability over cleverness**.
- Keep dependencies minimal.
